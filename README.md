# Web Development Portfolio

## Description

This Web Development Portfolio was created to showcase my portfolio. It contains a section about me, my work so far, as well as my contact information. This is for future employers to look at when I am applying for jobs in web development. This application helped me improve my CSS skills, but also showed me what HTML and CSS topics I need to work on further. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When the user first sees the webpage, they can use the navigation bar to click on "about-me," "work," or "contact-me" to go to either one of those sections. My name is displayed at the top, as well as a hero banner beneath it. 

In the "about-me" section, the user can see a paragraph about me and a picture of me on the left of the text. The "work" section contains the two projects I have completed so far in bootcamp. The user can click the title of the project and it will take them to that link in the same browser. Below is my "contact-me" section, which includes my phone number, email, GitHub profile, and LinkedIn profile. When the user clicks on GitHub or LinkedIn, they will be taken to those designated pages in the same browser.
